### To install on Chrome
Open [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) and make sure `Developer Mode` is enabled in the top right corner. Then click the `Load unpacked` button and navigate to the sample extension folder. Once installed, click the extension's icon ("E") in the browser's top right toolbar to see popup.html. (It may be in the "puzzle piece" menu.)

### Change the extension ID to test payments
You'll need to sign up for an account and register an extension on [ExtensionPay.com](https://extensionpay.com) to test payments.

Once you've done that, change the extension ID from `sample-extension` to your extension's ID in `background.js` and `popup.js`.
